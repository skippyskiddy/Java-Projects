## Summary

This assignment involves implementing an immutable Priority Queue data structure using a linked-list recursive data structure in Java, called ListPriorityQueue. The PriorityQueue interface contains methods to create an empty priority queue, check if the priority queue is empty, add an element to the priority queue, get the value of the highest priority element, and remove the highest priority element. The PQ is ordered from highest to lowest priority, and multiple elements with the same priority are returned based on the earliest added element. An exception, EmptyPriorityQueueException, is thrown when calling peek() or pop() on an empty PQ.

The assignment requires implementing the PriorityQueue protocol using a concrete class, ListPriorityQueue, which adheres to the specifications given. The priority queue must be immutable, and the range of acceptable priorities is 1..10. Implementing the PQ requires considering the order of the elements based on their priority and adding elements to the queue while preserving the order. The use of Java built-in collections is not allowed, and a UML class diagram is required to illustrate the structural design of the solution. The assignment emphasizes building a data structure from scratch and creating unit tests that adhere to the external client's access.
