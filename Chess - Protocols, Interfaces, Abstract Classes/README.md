## Summary

This assignment involves designing and implementing classes that represent the various chess pieces, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. The assignment was an instance of practice with sub-typing, polymorphism, and designing appropriate interfaces and classes.

The ChessPiece interface contains four methods that allow each piece to return its current position, color, and determine if it can move to a given cell or if it can kill a provided piece. The classes for each piece should be named exactly as their names and has a constructor that takes in an initial position as a row and column, and a color as an enum.

The assignment does not consider board setup or obstructing pieces on the board, but rather, it aims to determine if a move or capture is valid for a given piece.
