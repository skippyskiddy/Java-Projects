## Summary

This project requires designing and implementing classes to represent various chess pieces, such as pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. The goal is to practice sub-typing, polymorphism, and designing appropriate interfaces and classes.

The ChessPiece interface has four methods allowing each piece to return its current position and color and determine if it can move to a given cell or kill a provided piece. Each piece class should have the same name as the piece and a constructor taking an initial position as a row and column and a color as an enum.

This project does not involve board setup or obstructing pieces on the board. Rather, it focuses on determining whether a move or capture is valid for a given piece.
