# Java-Projects

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Java projects. Overall, these projects provide experience with object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms in Java and cover topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, exceptions, and testing.


Notable projects include:

* [Hotel Booking System](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Java-Projects/tree/main/Hotel%20Room%20Booking%20-%20Method%20Designs%20and%20Exceptions): This project provides practice with designing class hierarchies, creating and using Java enums and packages, implementing exception handling, and writing JUnit tests for classes. This project also involves practicing basic class composition and writing getter methods, which are essential skills for object-oriented programming.

* [Priority Queue](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Java-Projects/tree/main/Priority%20Queue%20-%20Recursive%20Data%20Structures): This project involves implementing the PriorityQueue protocol using a concrete class, ListPriorityQueue, which adheres to the specifications given. The priority queue is immutable, and the range of acceptable priorities is 1..10. Implementing the PQ requires considering the order of the elements based on their priority and adding elements to the queue while preserving the order.

* [Employee Payroll Management System](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Java-Projects/tree/main/Employees%20-%20Composition%2C%20Inheritance%2C%20Refactoring%20): This project provides practice with composition, delegation, and inheritance, as well as working with interfaces and implementing different classes to represent different types of employees and paychecks. It involves designing and implementing code for managing package lockers, including classes for Recipient, MailItem, and Locker.

* [MVC Photo Album](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Java-Projects/tree/main/MVC%20-%20Shapes%20Photo%20Album%20(Model)) - The MVC project provides a good understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and how it can be implemented in Java. The project involves designing a simple application that allows users to browse and manage a photo album. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application and the Controller handles user input and manages the interaction between the Model and View.
