## Summary 

This assignment consists of two parts, each with its own set of requirements. The first part involves creating a class to represent different types of rooms in a hotel booking system. The Room class has a constructor that takes a RoomType enum and a double representing the price of the room. The Room class has methods to check if the room is available, book the room, and get the number of guests currently assigned to the room. 

The second part involves designing and implementing code for managing package lockers, including classes for Recipient, MailItem, and Locker. Recipient and MailItem classes should has constructors that take appropriate parameters, and the Locker class has a constructor that takes maximum width, height, and depth as parameters. The Locker class also has methods to add and pickup mail items, with appropriate exception handling and validation checks. 

The main takeaways from this assignment are designing class hierarchies, creating and using Java enums and packages, implementing exception handling, and writing JUnit tests for classes. This assignment also involves practicing basic class composition and writing getter methods, which are essential skills for object-oriented programming.
