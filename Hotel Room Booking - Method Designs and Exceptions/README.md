## Summary 

This project consists of two parts. In the first part, a Room class is created to represent different types of rooms in a hotel booking system. The class has methods to check if the room is available, book the room, and get the number of guests currently assigned to the room. This project provides practice in designing and implementing code for class hierarchies, writing getter methods, and using Java enums.

The second part involves designing and implementing code for managing package lockers, including classes for Recipient, MailItem, and Locker. The Locker class has methods to add and pickup mail items, with appropriate exception handling and validation checks. This project involves practicing basic class composition, exception handling, and writing JUnit tests for classes. The main takeaways from this project are designing class hierarchies, implementing exception handling, and writing tests for classes.
