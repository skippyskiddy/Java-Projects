 * CS5004 Spring 2023
 * This class represents a hotel room, which has a room constructor with several room types, and
 * assisting methods to book rooms, check if they are available, and return a number of guests.
 * All rooms have:
 * 1. A maximum occupancy - This is the maximum number of people that can stay in the room.
 * 2. A price - The cost of a single nightâ€™s stay. The price of a room cannot be negative.
 * (We may decide to give people free ("comp") rooms as a perk if they're Diamond members).
 * 3. A number of guests - The number of guests currently booked into the room.
 * This value should be set to 0 when the room is first created in the system
