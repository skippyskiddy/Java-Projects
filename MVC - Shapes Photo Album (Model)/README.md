## Summary

This project involves designing a model for a photo album application that allows users to create simple photo albums from shapes. The project is an exercise in practicing the "separation of concerns" covered in class and using the Model-View-Controller architecture. In this first part of the project, the focus is on the model, and the assignment is relatively open-ended, allowing for freedom in design decisions.

The project begins by providing a context for the application and outlining what needs to be achieved. The application must be able to support various kinds of 2D shapes and transformations, such as moving, changing color, and scaling. The model should be designed to represent a shapes photo album, and operations relevant to the model should be included. The final deliverables for the project include a high-level UML class diagram, a well-documented model, and a text README file explaining the design.
