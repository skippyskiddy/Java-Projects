## Summary

This project involves the implementation of a questionnaire system that includes different types of questions, including YesNo, ShortAnswer, and Likert questions. The questions have common attributes such as text, required/optional status, and answer string, and a method to get the answer. The constructors for the classes take the question prompt as a String and a boolean to indicate if the question is required.

Additionally, the project includes an interface, Questionnaire, that represents a collection of questions. The implementation includes the QuestionnaireImpl class, which implements the Questionnaire interface and uses the List interface to store the questions. This project provides an opportunity to practice implementing interfaces, working with collections, and building classes that enforce answer requirements.
